# CV-MLOps-Open-source-Data

The 385 ship images and 62 airplane images contained in this repository were taken from the open-source SeabedObjects(Ship and Airplane) dataset, https://github.com/huoguanying/SeabedObjects-Ship-and-Airplane-dataset.  

The purpose of this task is to determine appropriate object classes based on the types and discernable features of the images and manually label each image.
